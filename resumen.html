    <h2 style="align-content: center;text-align: center;">The Wankel engine is a type of engine
internal combustion, invented by felix wankel, who
uses the rotors in the timing of the pistons of the engines
alternative
Wankel conceived his rotary engine in 1924 and received
his patent in 1929. During the 1940s he devoted himself to
improve the design A considerable effort was made in the
Development of rotary engines in the 1950s and 1960s.
They were particularly interesting to operate from a
Smooth, silent and reliable mode, thanks to the simplicity of
his design <br>In an alternative engine; in the same volume (milliliters)
4 different jobs are carried out successively: admission,
compression, combustion and exhaust. In a Wankel engine it
they develop the same four times but in places
other than the housing or block; with the piston moving
continuously from one to the other. More specifically, the cylinder
It is a cavity with the shape of 8, inside which
find a triangular rotor that makes a center turn
variable. This piston communicates its rotary movement to a
crankshaft that is inside, and that already rotates with a single center.
